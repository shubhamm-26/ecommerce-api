## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v12 or higher)
- MongoDB (or another suitable database)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ecommerce-api.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd ecommerce-api
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Configuration

1. Configuration settings for the API are typically managed using environment variables. While this assignment doesn't require an `.env` file, you can still provide placeholders for the configuration settings:

   - **Database:** Configure the database connection details.
   - **JWT Secret:** Set a secret key for JWT token generation and verification.

2. To configure the API, locate the configuration files in the project and update the necessary placeholders as indicated.

## API Endpoints

- ... (List the API endpoints as previously described)

## Authentication

The API uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user authentication. Users can register, log in, and obtain a token to authenticate API requests.

## Error Handling

The API includes appropriate error handling mechanisms to provide meaningful error messages and status codes in response to different scenarios.

## Documentation

The API documentation is available through Swagger. You can access the Swagger documentation by navigating to `http://localhost:3000/api-docs` after starting the server.

## Rate Limiting

Rate limiting is implemented to prevent abuse and maintain server stability. Requests to sensitive endpoints are limited to a certain number per time window.
